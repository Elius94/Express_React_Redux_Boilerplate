## A nice boilerplate to start wit Node.js and React

Use this repository to build a webapp with Express.js (backend) and React+Redux (frontend).

This webapp uses RESTFULL APIs using HTTP Post messages.
React app talk with the server using a Bkconnect Js file.

In this example I use Postgres for DB.

Have fun!

chmod +x ./serve.sh
